# natural-selection
A collection of code inspired by [this series of youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDvzbBRiNlA&list=PLKortajF2dPBWMIS6KF4RLtQiG6KQrTdB) by [Primer.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ)

A've organized it by each concept examined that I found interesting.

## aggression
The first concept is the trait of aggression, and how it affects the population dynamic. In my code, I've simulated the classic game-theoretic _hawks and doves_ approach to the problem. Following is a short description of the algorithm. 
* Simulation runs for a specified number of days, and consists of a specified number of locations
* Each location has two pieces of food
* Each day, the location of each organism is randomized
